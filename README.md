Every program is a prompt.

## Synopsis:

- The program has to somehow talk to a central API.
- For example in the case of the thesaurus program, it has to talk to the central API.
- The central API is for now hardcoded to mean "ChatGTP" API, but later on it could be any API like Jasper, etc.
- Let's say we're talking about a simple chat app. This one is special because it doesn't have a prompt, since it's meant to talk straigh to the central API without a prompt. What what it does have is a Memory.
